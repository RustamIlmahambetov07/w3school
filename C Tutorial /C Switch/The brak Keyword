/* The break Keyword
When C reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block.

This will stop the execution of more code and case testing inside the block.

When a match is found, and the job is done, it's time for a break. There is no need for more testing. */

/* A break can save a lot of execution time because it "ignores" the execution of all the rest of the code in the switch block. */
