// The default keyword specifies some code to run if there is no case match:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int day = 4;
  
  switch (day) {
  case 6:
    printf("Today is Saturday");
    break;
  case 7:
    printf("Today is Sunday");
    break;
  default:
    printf("Looking forward to the Weekend");
  }
  
  return 0;
}

// Note: The default keyword must be used as the last statement in the switch, and it does not need a break.
