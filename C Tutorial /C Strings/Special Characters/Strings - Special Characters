/* Because strings must be written within quotes, C will misunderstand this string, and generate an error: */

char txt[] = "We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north.";

/* The solution to avoid this problem, is to use the backslash escape character.

The backslash (\) escape character turns special characters into string characters: */

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  char txt[] = "It\'s alright.";
  printf("%s", txt);
 
  return 0;
}
