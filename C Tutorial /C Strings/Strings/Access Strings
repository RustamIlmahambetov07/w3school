/* Since strings are actually arrays in C, you can access a string by referring to its index number inside square brackets [].

This example prints the first character (0) in greetings: */

// Example

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  char greetings[] = "Hello World!";
  printf("%c", greetings[0]);
 
  return 0;
}

/* Note that we have to use the %c format specifier to print a single character. */
