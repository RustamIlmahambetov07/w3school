/* In the examples above, we used a "string literal" to create a string variable. This is the easiest way to create a string in C.

You should also note that you can create a string with a set of characters. This example will produce the same result as the example in the beginning of this page: */

// Example

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  char greetings[] = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ' ', 'W', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd', '!', '\0'};
  char greetings2[] = "Hello World!";
  
  printf("%s\n", greetings);
  printf("%s\n", greetings2);
  
  return 0;
}

/* Why do we include the \0 character at the end? This is known as the "null terminating character", and must be included when creating strings using this method. It tells C that this is the end of the string. */
