/* The difference between the two ways of creating strings, is that the first method is easier to write, and you do not have to include the \0 character, as C will do it for you.

You should note that the size of both arrays is the same: They both have 13 characters (space also counts as a character by the way), including the \0 character: */

// Example

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  char greetings[] = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ' ', 'W', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd', '!', '\0'};
  char greetings2[] = "Hello World!";
  
  printf("%lu\n", sizeof(greetings));
  printf("%lu\n", sizeof(greetings2));
  
  return 0;
}
