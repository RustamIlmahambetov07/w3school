/* Strings are used for storing text/characters.

For example, "Hello World" is a string of characters.

Unlike many other programming languages, C does not have a String type to easily create string variables. Instead, you must use the char type and create an array of characters to make a string in C: */

char greetings[] = "Hello World!";

/* Note that you have to use double quotes ("").

To output the string, you can use the printf() function together with the format specifier %s to tell C that we are now working with strings: */

// Example

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  char greetings[] = "Hello World!";
  printf("%s", greetings);
 
  return 0;
}
