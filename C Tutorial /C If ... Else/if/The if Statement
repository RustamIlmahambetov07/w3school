/* Use the if statement to specify a block of code to be executed if a condition is true. */

// Syntax

if (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}

// Note that if is in lowercase letters. Uppercase letters (If or IF) will generate an error.

/* In the example below, we test two values to find out if 20 is greater than 18. If the condition is true, print some text: */

// example 

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  if (20 > 18) {
    printf("20 is greater than 18");
  }  
  return 0;
}

// We can also test variables:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int x = 20;
  int y = 18;
  if (x > y) {
    printf("x is greater than y");
  }  
  return 0;
}

/* Example explained
In the example above we use two variables, x and y, to test whether x is greater than y (using the > operator). As x is 20, and y is 18, and we know that 20 is greater than 18, we print to the screen that "x is greater than y". */
