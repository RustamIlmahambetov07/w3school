/* There is also a short-hand if else, which is known as the ternary operator because it consists of three operands. It can be used to replace multiple lines of code with a single line. It is often used to replace simple if else statements: */

// Syntax

variable = (condition) ? expressionTrue : expressionFalse;

// Instead of writing:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int time = 20;
  if (time < 18) {
    printf("Good day.");
  } else {
    printf("Good evening.");
  }
  return 0;
}

// You can simply write:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int time = 20;
  (time < 18) ? printf("Good day.") : printf("Good evening.");
  return 0;
}

// It is completely up to you if you want to use the traditional if...else statement or the ternary operator.
