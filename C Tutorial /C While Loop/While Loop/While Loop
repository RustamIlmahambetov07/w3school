/* The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true: */

// Syntax

while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}

/* In the example below, the code in the loop will run, over and over again, as long as a variable (i) is less than 5: */

// Example

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int i = 0;
  
  while (i < 5) {
    printf("%d\n", i);
    i++;
  }
  
  return 0;
}

// Note: Do not forget to increase the variable used in the condition (i++), otherwise the loop will never end!
