/* Sometimes, you have to convert the value of one data type to another type. This is known as type conversion.

For example, if you try to divide two integers, 5 by 2, you would expect the result to be 2.5. But since we are working with integers (and not floating-point values), the following example will just output 2: */

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int x = 5;
  int y = 2;
  int sum = 5 / 2;

  printf("%d", sum);
  return 0;
}

/* To get the right result, you need to know how type conversion works.

There are two types of conversion in C:

Implicit Conversion (automatically)
Explicit Conversion (manually) */
