/*The char data type is used to store a single character.

The character must be surrounded by single quotes, like 'A' or 'c', and we use the %c format specifier to print it: */

//example 

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  char myGrade = 'A';
  printf("%c", myGrade);
  return 0;
}

/* Alternatively, if you are familiar with ASCII, you can use ASCII values to display certain characters. Note that these values are not surrounded by quotes (''), as they are numbers: */

//example

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  char a = 65, b = 66, c = 67;
  printf("%c\n", a);
  printf("%c\n", b);
  printf("%c", c);
  return 0;
}

/* Tip: A list of all ASCII values can be found in our ASCII Table Reference. */
