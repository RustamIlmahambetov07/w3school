/* If you try to store more than a single character, it will only print the last character: */

//example 

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  char myText = 'Hello';
  printf("%c", myText);
  return 0;
}

/* Note: Don't use the char type for storing multiple characters, as it may produce errors.

To store multiple characters (or whole words), use strings (which you will learn more about in a later chapter): */

//example 

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  char myText[] = "Hello";
  printf("%s", myText);
  return 0;
}
