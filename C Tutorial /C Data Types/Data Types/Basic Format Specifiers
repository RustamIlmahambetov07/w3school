Basic Format Specifiers
There are different format specifiers for each data type. Here are some of them:

Format Specifier	Data Type	Try it
%d or %i	int	
%f or %F	float	
%lf	double	
%c	char	
%s	Used for strings (text), which you will learn more about in a later chapter	
Note: It is important that you use the correct format specifier for the specified data type. If not, the program may produce errors or even crash.
