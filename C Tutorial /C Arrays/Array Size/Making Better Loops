/* In the array loops section in the previous chapter, we wrote the size of the array in the loop condition (i < 4). This is not ideal, since it will only work for arrays of a specified size.

However, by using the sizeof formula from the example above, we can now make loops that work for arrays of any size, which is more sustainable.

Instead of writing: */

// Example

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int myNumbers[] = {25, 50, 75, 100};
  int i;
  
  for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    printf("%d\n", myNumbers[i]);
  }
 
  return 0;
}

// It is better to write:

// Example

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int myNumbers[] = {25, 50, 75, 100};
  int length = sizeof(myNumbers) / sizeof(myNumbers[0]);
  int i;

  for (i = 0; i < length; i++) {
    printf("%d\n", myNumbers[i]);
  }
  
  return 0;
}
