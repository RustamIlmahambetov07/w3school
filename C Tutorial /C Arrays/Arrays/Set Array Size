/* Another common way to create arrays, is to specify the size of the array, and add elements later: */ 

// Example

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  // Declare an array of four integers:
  int myNumbers[4];

  // Add elements to it
  myNumbers[0] = 25;
  myNumbers[1] = 50;
  myNumbers[2] = 75;
  myNumbers[3] = 100;

  printf("%d\n", myNumbers[0]);
 
  return 0;
}

/* Using this method, you should know the number of array elements in advance, in order for the program to store enough memory.

You are not able to change the size of the array after creation. */
