/* In C, the bool type is not a built-in data type, like int or char.

It was introduced in C99, and you must import the following header file to use it: */

#include <stdbool.h>

/* A boolean variable is declared with the bool keyword and can take the values true or false: */

bool isProgrammingFun = true;
bool isFishTasty = false;

/* Before trying to print the boolean variables, you should know that boolean values are returned as integers:

* 1 (or any other number that is not 0) represents true
* 0 represents false
Therefore, you must use the %d format specifier to print a boolean value: */

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdbool.h>  // Import the boolean header file 

int main() {
  bool isProgrammingFun = true;
  bool isFishTasty = false;
  printf("%d\n", isProgrammingFun);  // Returns 1 (true)
  printf("%d", isFishTasty);         // Returns 0 (false)
  
  return 0;
}

/* However, it is more common to return a boolean value by comparing values and variables. */
