/* Let's think of a "real life example" where we need to find out if a person is old enough to vote.

In the example below, we use the >= comparison operator to find out if the age (25) is greater than OR equal to the voting age limit, which is set to 18: */

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int myAge = 25;
  int votingAge = 18;
  
  printf("%d", myAge >= votingAge); // Returns 1 (true), meaning 25 year olds are allowed to vote!
  return 0;
}

/* Cool, right? An even better approach (since we are on a roll now), would be to wrap the code above in an if...else statement, so we can perform different actions depending on the result: */

// Example
// Output "Old enough to vote!" if myAge is greater than or equal to 18. Otherwise output "Not old enough to vote.":

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int myAge = 25;
  int votingAge = 18;

  if (myAge >= votingAge) {
    printf("Old enough to vote!");
  } else {
    printf("Not old enough to vote.");
  }
  
  return 0;
}
