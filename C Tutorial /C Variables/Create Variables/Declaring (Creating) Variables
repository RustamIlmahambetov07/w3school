To create a variable, specify the type and assign it a value:

Syntax
type variableName = value;
Where type is one of C types (such as int), and variableName is the name of the variable (such as x or myName). The equal sign is used to assign a value to the variable.

So, to create a variable that should store a number, look at the following example:

Example
Create a variable called myNum of type int and assign the value 15 to it:

int myNum = 15;
You can also declare a variable without assigning the value, and assign the value later:

Example
// Declare a variable
int myNum;

// Assign a value to the variable
myNum = 15;
