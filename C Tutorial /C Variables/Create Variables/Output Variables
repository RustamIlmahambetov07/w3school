You learned from the output chapter that you can output values/print text with the printf() function:

Example
printf("Hello World!");
In many other programming languages (like Python, Java, and C++), you would normally use a print function to display the value of a variable. However, this is not possible in C:

Example
int myNum = 15;
printf(myNum);  // Nothing happens
